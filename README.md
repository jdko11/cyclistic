The Cyclistic Bike-Share Marketing Analysis is the first case study of Googleâ€™s Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. 

In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

I've done analysis work using spreadsheet, BigQuery, Tableau, and R.

Thank you for taking interest in my work.
